# Governance Rule Registry

This registry describes rule packs distributed by the framework. It is the
machine-readable authority used by `governance_tools/rule_classifier.py` for
context-aware activation. External contracts may add packs through their own
`contract.yaml` `rule_roots`; those packs do not need to be catalogued here.

Machine values:

- `artifact_state`: `implemented` or `planned`
- `ownership`: `framework`, `external-contract`, or `unresolved`
- `activation_mode`: `always`, `context_aware`, `explicit_only`, or `none`
- `repo_type`: `firmware`, `product`, `service`, `tooling`, or `all`
- `task_type`: `general`, `refactor`, `release`, `review`, `onboarding`, `test`, or `all`

Operational rules:

- Only `artifact_state: implemented` entries may be activated.
- `planned` entries must use `activation_mode: none` and remain absent from
  active, preview, warning, skill, and agent outputs.
- `explicit_only` entries are never selected by context classification. They
  load only when explicitly requested by runtime rules or a contract.
- Unknown metadata fields are forward-compatible and must not break parsing.
- `load_mode` is a legacy parser alias for `activation_mode`; new registry
  entries use `activation_mode` only.

## Quick Reference

| Pack | Artifact | Ownership | Activation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `common` | implemented | framework | always | Core coding baseline |
| `cpp` | implemented | framework | context-aware | C and C++ rules |
| `csharp` | implemented | framework | context-aware | C# rules |
| `python` | implemented | framework | context-aware | Python rules |
| `swift` | implemented | framework | context-aware | Swift rules |
| `avalonia` | implemented | framework | context-aware | Avalonia UI rules |
| `refactor` | implemented | framework | context-aware | Refactoring rules |
| `kernel-driver` | implemented | framework | context-aware | Framework driver baseline; external contracts may override it |
| `gl-hub-vendor-cmd` | implemented | external-contract | explicit-only | Contract-authorized GL hub vendor-command rules |
| `release` | planned | framework | none | Reserved release checklist slot |
| `typescript` | planned | framework | none | Reserved TypeScript/Node.js slot |
| `electron` | planned | framework | none | Reserved Electron IPC/security slot |
| `firmware_isr` | planned | unresolved | none | Reserved generic ISR slot pending authority review |

`nextjs`, `supabase`, and `review_gate` were removed as stale declarations on
2026-07-13. The decision record is
`docs/governance/2026-07-13-rule-registry-classification-decision.md`.

## Selection Boundary

Context-aware classification is advisory and must intersect the registry
metadata above. Runtime content loading remains fail-closed and resolves actual
pack folders. External contract rule roots precede the framework rule root, so
a contract-local pack may intentionally override a framework baseline.

Explicit runtime rules have final authority. Heuristic suggestions never load a
pack automatically.
